/* This class wraps a 9 micro grid in Sudoku game but with one matrix of size 9x9. 
 * Typically, there is only 1 macro grids in Sudoku game. 
 *
 * The features of this grid type is that:
 *
 * 1- it contains distinct numbers ranges from 1 to 9 per each row/column.
 * 2- it should perform membership-testing fast since it is expected frequently to check whether a
 *    number exists in a given row/column.
 * 3- Ordered objects is a requiremnt to be able to have a macro row/columne of 9 elements at any time
 * There NSOrderedSet/NSMutableOrderedSet classes in Objective-C that meet these requirements of
 * single row/column in macro grid.
 *
 * The whole rows and columns would be placed in single mutable order set. Thus interfacing with
 * Data Source would be straightforward.
